# ATM-MACHINE

This is a basic console-based banking system in Python that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check their balance, and change their ATM PIN. The system uses the `pyttsx3` library to provide text-to-speech feedback. Account information, including account number, phone number, PIN, and balance, is stored in dictionaries. The system ensures secure handling of transactions by validating account details. Users can interact with the system through a simple menu interface.
